// Threat-model finding F13: three supply-chain controls the design left unstated. Two of them
// are facts about files in this repository, so they are asserted here rather than described
// anywhere. The third, provenance at publish, is a property of the release workflow and is
// checked by scripts/release-preflight.ts and by actionlint over .github/workflows/release.yml.
//
// The shipping shape is here for the same reason: `files`, `bin` and the path the benchmark
// rig weighs all have to name the same bundle, and three places that agree by hand drift.
//
// The workflow model an assertion names a job of lives in test/helpers/workflow.ts, so this
// file and the release gate read one parser rather than two: an assertion is about the
// `publish` job's permissions, not about the word "write" anywhere in the file.
