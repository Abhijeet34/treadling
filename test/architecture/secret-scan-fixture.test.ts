// The synthetic AWS credential AGENTS.md's "Secret scanning" section relies on the gate
// catching. gitleaks' aws-access-token rule - both in the fleet's canonical .gitleaks.toml
// (which extends gitleaks' defaults rather than restating them) and in vanilla gitleaks 8.30.1
// - is
//   (A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|ASIA|ABIA|ACCA)[A-Z2-7]{16}
// a base32-style tail that excludes the digits 0, 1, 8 and 9. A uniform draw from the full
// uppercase-alphanumeric alphabet lands one of those four digits about 85% of the time
// (measured below) and then the line matches no rule at all, not even the generic one: a
// planted AKIA + digit-bearing tail on a line by itself scans clean under this repository's
// own .gitleaks.toml. This file pins the fixture generator to the charset the rule actually
// requires, so a change to either drifts loudly instead of quietly.
