// The documents carry numbers about the tool, and nothing noticed them going stale. The
// README said sixteen commands when the inventory had nineteen, six work-item types when
// there were seven, and eight of fifteen backlog items in draft when the workspace held
// seven. Every one of those was true the day it was written. A prose claim about a count is
// the kind of rot a reader cannot detect and a reviewer will not, because the number looks
// like every other number.
//
// So the checkable claims are checked here. What belongs in this file is a documented figure
// derived from something in this tree: a command inventory, a closed set, a table of rule
// ids, the workspace the README points at. What does not belong is a measurement, a wall
// time, a byte count of the tree or a coverage decimal, because those move on a commit that
// changed nothing about the claim; docs/VERIFICATION.md carries those with their dates.
