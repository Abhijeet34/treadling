// What `doctor` reports, and what the exit status and `status` say beside it.
//
// The findings from round five that survived ADR-0029 meet here and they are one question
// asked three ways: which set is a membership test run against, and which findings does a
// reader actually get shown. A record the store quarantined still exists, so a neighbour
// pointing at it is not dangling; a finding that hides nothing is not the verdict; and a
// count that names one set has to say which set it names.
//
// Two of the round's findings were about `sprint_id`, and both went with the sprint.
