// The other half of the removal race: a `parent_id` naming a record the store does not hold.
//
// The store now refuses to write one (`S17` and the parent half of `S10`), but a state no
// write path would accept still reaches the files by the routes D1 permits: a hand edit, a
// git merge, an older build, a crash between two writes. `doctor` reported clean over one,
// which is worse than the dangling reference itself, because the tool's own health check was
// silent about a record every read then answered from as if the parent were there. `H24`
// covers a relation's target; `H30` is the same rule for a parent.
//
// The quarantine case is here for the reason round five's is: a record the store holds and
// refuses to serve still exists, so a child pointing at it is not dangling.
