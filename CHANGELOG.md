## [0.2.2](https://github.com/Abhijeet34/treadling/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2) (2026-09-10)


### Documentation

* correct docs now that @abhijeet34/treadling is published, without implying the pipeline publishes it ([#106](https://github.com/Abhijeet34/treadling/issues/106)) ([be49583](https://github.com/Abhijeet34/treadling/commit/be495838273de4ced4e98977ab5ad83b48a877f0))

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-10)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **domain:** `reporter` is no longer a work-item field. `show` emits schema `show/3` without it, a gate rule reading it is refused `V6`, and `set <id> reporter=` is refused `V5`.
* **store:** `S14`, the rule for two events sharing an id, is gone with the table that owned it, and both copies of a repeated event id are now served. A damaged event line no longer refuses `status` or `backlog`; it refuses `history`, `explain` and `doctor`, which are the reads that answer from the log. The `.index/` directory is neither read nor written, and the transaction journal is at `.txn/`; a workspace written by an earlier build reads unchanged and its `.index/` is inert.
* **cut:** `sprint`, `sprints`, `ceremonies` and `board` are gone, as are `--points`, `--sprint`, `--preview`, `--color` and `--no-input`, the `points`, `hours_estimate`, `timebox_hours`, `sprint_id` and `component` fields, guard `G4`, gate rule `DOR5`, doctor findings `H26`, `H28` and `H29`, and the `point_scale`, `cycle_time_excludes_hold` and `start_requires_sprint` configuration keys. Fourteen result schemas move: `backlog` and `status` to v3, and `config`, `evidence`, `explain`, `file`, `init`, `mark`, `next`, `relation`, `remove`, `set`, `show` and `transition` to v2. A record written by an earlier build still reads.
* **cli:** a single-valued flag written twice on one line is now VALIDATION at exit 2 where it exited 0 and used the last value, and a column named twice in --fields is the same refusal. Write the flag once, and name each column once; the refusal offers the de-duplicated line.
* **status:** the status result object no longer declares absent_features, and its schema id is status/2.
* **sprint:** `file --sprint <id>` now refuses an id that names no open sprint and an item that cannot enter one (I2, I4); it stored any string before. `set <id> sprint_id=` is refused in favour of `treadle sprint commit`.
* **store:** close the lock, symlink, and event-log gaps found in the second adversarial pass ([#29](https://github.com/Abhijeet34/treadle/issues/29))
* **cli:** a command run against a store that holds a record it cannot serve exits 7 where it exited 0 with the record missing from its count, `doctor` exits 7 with findings where it exited 0, and a domain integrity error exits 7 where it exited 6. Nothing is released; these are release notes under docs/STABILITY.md rather than a bump.
* **cli:** with no command word, any global flag the tool cannot honour is now refused instead of being silently dropped. On d1a9391 `treadle --out` (a value missing) and `treadle --quiet=1` (a value on a boolean) both exited 0 and ran the default `status` command with the flag dropped or misparsed; both now exit 2, with `--out needs a value` and `--quiet takes no value`. `treadle --nope` exits 2 with `--nope is not a flag of treadle`. docs/STABILITY.md calls a new non-zero exit for a case that used to succeed breaking, and release-please-config.json sets `bump-minor-pre-major: true`, so this bumps the minor.
