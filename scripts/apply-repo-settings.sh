# Applies the repository settings that are not files, from the files that describe them.
# Idempotent: a ruleset whose name already exists is updated in place rather than duplicated,
# which is what makes this safe to re-run after editing one of the JSON files.
#
# Usage: scripts/apply-repo-settings.sh OWNER/REPO
#
# Every step runs even when an earlier one fails, and every failure is named together at the
# end. Stopping at the first refusal exited 1 having applied some settings and not others,
# and the exit code could not say which half happened: on 2026-09-05 a rejected tag ruleset
# silently skipped the repository settings and both Actions permission calls.
#
# docs/RELEASING.md, "The settings that are not files", carries the reasoning; this file
# carries the commands so nobody retypes them.
#
# Writes go through plain `gh api`: `gh-axi api` has no -X and no --input, so every write
# here was refused with VALIDATION_ERROR and nothing was ever applied through it.
