// A pull request may not quietly drop a test that main already has.
//
// #29 was rebased onto a main that carried #28, four service files conflicted, and the
// resolution took the pre-rebase file whole. That threw away #28's code and #28's tests in
// one move, so the suite reported 1132 passing tests and all ten checks were green while four
// landed fixes sat one merge away from being undone. A test only protects a behaviour while
// the test survives, so a suite cannot be asked whether a suite was cut.
//
// The comparison is therefore against a commit on main and never against the branch. The set
// of test titles at the merge base is a fact about main that a resolution cannot edit,
// however completely it rewrites the branch's own files. `strict_required_status_checks_policy`
// in .github/rulesets/main.json is what keeps that merge base at main's tip: a branch behind
// main cannot merge, so the comparison a merge is gated on is always against main as it is.
//
// A removal that is meant is declared in a commit message, one trailer naming one exact
// title, and AGENTS.md carries the wording. What the mechanism does not see is in
// docs/VERIFICATION.md under "What check-tests-kept does not see".
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-tests-kept.ts [<branch-ref>] [<head-ref>], defaulting to origin/main and HEAD
