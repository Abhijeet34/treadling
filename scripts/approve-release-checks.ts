// Releases the release pull request's parked runs, so nothing about a release waits on a
// person to click.
//
// release-please opens that pull request as `github-actions[bot]`, which holds no write
// access and is no collaborator here, so this repository's
// `all_external_contributors` approval policy parks every run on it. A parked run attaches no
// check to the pull request at all: `gh pr checks 69` reported "no CI checks configured"
// while forty-six runs sat at `action_required`, and `.github/rulesets/main.json` requires
// the `checks` context, so the one pull request that carries a release was the one pull
// request nothing could ever check. Four release pull requests waited four days that way.
//
// ADR-0037 is the decision to approve them here instead of reporting them, and what that
// trades away. The `release-pr-checks` job runs this with the run's own token and
// `actions: write`, so no credential is stored to make a release unattended.
//
// TypeScript over a `run:` body calling `gh` and `jq`: the parked-checks job it replaces was
// 60 lines of shell whose only test drove it through a stubbed binary on PATH, and this is
// driven directly with a request function instead.
