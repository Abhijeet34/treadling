# Verification

What this project claims about itself, what was measured, and what is not proven.

Every figure here comes from a run of the suite in this repository, on Node 24.11.1.
That is below the declared floor of 24.15 in `package.json`, so `npm install` warns.
The warning is expected here and changes no number below; nothing the tool needs is newer than Node 24.0.

Counts are per run, and every property suite prints its own count as a test diagnostic, so a run that generated less than it claims says so rather than reporting a silent pass.
Those diagnostics are the authority and this table is a transcription of them, which is the direction that lets a figure here go stale: eight rows below were re-derived on 2026-09-09 after the cuts of 2026-09-08 and 2026-09-09 moved what the suites generate, and each had been correct on the day it was written.
Re-derive a row by running the suite it names and reading the `ℹ` line, rather than by trusting this column.

## The claims

| Claim | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Round trip is byte-exact over generated adversarial documents | 2,000 documents, 1,971 records served and 1,734 quarantined, 0 bytes moved; 2,000 records, 1,109 accepted and every accepted one a fixed point of parse and render, 891 refused naming a rule; 1,000 work items either refuse at encode or return unchanged, 593 returned unchanged | Proven |
| A mutation applied twice is a no-op that writes nothing | 82 repeated transitions across the sequence walk, every one reported as a no-op with no transaction; 7 more checked by hashing the authoritative store either side, 0 bytes changed | Proven |
| Any sequence of legal commands leaves a store that still holds | 40 sequences of 25 commands, 1,000 invocations: 494 mutations, 293 reads, 213 refusals; 0 shards left unparseable, 0 quarantined records | Proven |
| The parser and the escaper survive fuzzing | 500,000 mutated inputs per run and 2,000,000 in the recorded soak, 0 crashes; slowest single input 1.0 ms against a 2,000 ms budget on 2026-09-09, and 227.9 ms against the same budget on a loaded machine, which is why the budget is generous rather than tight | Proven |
| No regex that reads foreign input can backtrack | 26 regex literals across the 4 files that read foreign input, every one of star height 1 or 0, by a scanner with its own self-test | Proven |
| N parallel processes leave zero corruption and zero lost updates | 24 separate processes over one record: 24 of 24 writes persisted, version 25, 24 events, 0 corrupt shards, 0 quarantined, 0 locks left behind | Proven |
| A process killed mid-write leaves the store intact | 30 SIGKILL trials: 30 stores parseable, 0 corrupt, 0 quarantined, every lock left behind reclaimed by the next writer, every journal replayed | Proven |
| A stale lock is recovered | Both forms: a holder whose process is provably gone, reclaimed in under 1 s; a live process whose heartbeat stopped, reclaimed. `EPERM` is treated as alive and the lock is not stolen | Proven |
| A hand edit during an operation is handled | 12 trials: 6 broken records quarantined and reported as findings with the record either side still serving, 6 concurrent edits leaving a shard that still parses, 0 stores left unreadable | Proven |
| Zero injection escapes across an adversarial corpus | 4,180 rendered cases over 19 result shapes: 2,234 decoded back to exactly the values that went in, 1,946 refused by the grammar naming the key, 0 escapes; 2,210 truncated streams carried no forged envelope | Proven |
| The seams take a second implementation | Store: 24 conformance tests against 2 real implementations. Renderer: 26 golden objects through 4 renderers, 104 renderings on 2026-09-08, the fourth written against 2 types and no code | Proven |
| No network egress | 18 commands run with 14 network entry points replaced by traps: 0 attempts | Proven |
| Coverage meets the gate | 97.54% lines and 89.81% branches against a 90/85 gate; every one of the 7 named files over its 95/90 bar | Proven |
| A flake budget of zero | 20 of 20 consecutive full runs completed and green, 0 failures, and the same test count in all 20, which is the condition `scripts/flake.ts` fails on if it moves; 50.9 s to 84.5 s each, 1,437 s in total | Proven |
| One regression test per closed security finding | 13 closed findings, each mapped to a named test that names the finding and carries assertions, 235 passing across the 13 files in one child run on 2026-09-10; 0 open findings, F4 having closed by absence with [architecture/adr/0035-a-verdict-that-records-nothing-and-a-rendering-for-a-person-go.md](architecture/adr/0035-a-verdict-that-records-nothing-and-a-rendering-for-a-person-go.md) | Proven |
| Every character of a random id is equally likely | Chi-squared 23.3 to 46.2 over ten runs of 600,000 characters against a ceiling of 120 on 35 degrees of freedom; the `byte % 36` implementation this replaced scored 1,340.6 on the same test | Proven |
| Every property can fail | 9 deliberate breakages of the product and the harness, 9 caught by the property that claims them | Proven |
| No literal invisible code point ships | Every tracked text file scanned, 0 carrying one; the run prints the count it read, which is a figure of the tree's size and so is not transcribed here; every such character in the suites is built from its number or written as an escape | Proven |
| Severity reaches every read surface | 5 of 5 surfaces print it for an S1 bug, against 0 of 5 before; `show --field sev` answers where it was a `C2` refusal | Proven |
| `next` separates an S1 from an S4 | At equal priority, 74, 56 and 50 for an S1 bug, an S4 bug and a third item, against 50, 50 and 50 before; severity's lift is bounded at 24, which is 2.4 priority levels. Measured while that third item was a `chore`, the type [ADR-0031](architecture/adr/0031-the-word-was-the-whole-difference-and-a-declared-kind-earns-its-writer.md) has since folded into `task`, which carries no severity either | Proven |
| Every severity and priority change the tool makes is an event with a before and an after | A `file` event's `after` carried 2 keys and now carries every audited field set; a `mark` carries `before`, `after`, the actor and the reason | Proven |
| A change made outside the tool is a finding | A hand edit from S1 to S4 and priority 1 to 5 produced 0 findings and now produces 2, each naming the stored value and the last one the log recorded | Proven |
| Both prose bounds refuse and neither truncates | 90,000-character description refused naming 90000, 10000 and 80000 over, shard unchanged; 10,000-character reason refused at `T7` naming 500 | Proven |
| A record over the old bound still reads | A 42,000-character stored description serves on `show` and is finding `H18`, where the first build quarantined it and reported `checked 0` | Proven |
| A done item points at evidence | `DOD7` is the only failing rule on an otherwise complete bug, and its remedy is the command that fixes it; a hand edit removing the section is `H21` | Proven |
| A paused lock holder never overwrites the writer that reclaimed it | A writer stopped with `SIGSTOP` inside its critical section, a competitor reclaiming after the 5 s window: before, 1 lost update in 117 writes with `doctor` clean; after, 5 runs of 5 with version equal to update events plus one, the paused writer refusing `LOCK_LOST`/`S16` or `CONFLICT`/`S10` (`test/store/lock.test.ts`) | Proven |
| No symbolic link at or below the workspace root is followed | 7 paths each replaced by a link to a directory outside the workspace, `items` among them: before, `file` wrote its shard through the link; after, every read and write refuses `S15` naming the link and its target, 0 bytes written outside (`test/store/symlink.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The event log holds the same property the record files hold | An instant naming month 13 sorted after every real event; now refused. A blank line moved the reported line of an appended bad line by one; now the line the file has (`test/store/event-log-integrity.test.ts`, `test/services/event-audit.test.ts`). A repeated event id is not refused: both copies are served in file and line order, which [ADR-0030](architecture/adr/0030-the-index-goes-and-a-read-parses-the-files.md) decided | Partly proven, and narrower than it was |
| A duplicate-id finding goes with the file it clashed against | A shard copied to a second month and then removed left `S3` refusing every read until the surviving shard changed. Every read now decides `S3` from the shards it just parsed, so a clash cannot outlive the file it was decided against and the column that used to make that true is gone (`test/store/event-log-integrity.test.ts`) | Proven, by construction |
| An unreadable store refuses rather than answering empty | `EACCES` on the items directory answered `items 0` at exit 0 from `status`, `doctor` and `backlog`, `NOT_FOUND` from `show`, and `history` answered "no recorded change" over an unreadable log; an unreadable shard escaped as exit 1 `INTERNAL` with no rule id. All five now refuse `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`/`S13` at exit 6 naming the path and the failing syscall, in all three renderings (`test/cli/unreadable-store.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The store never writes a record it would not serve back | `set acceptance_criteria="a\nb"` landed and every read after it exited 7; now refused at 2 as `V4`, and the store parses every record it renders before the write (`test/cli/found-by-use.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The lock reclaim race resolves without an overlapping hold | 24 waiters over 600 contended reclaims, 0 overlapping holds | Proven |
| A symlinked or a foreign-pid lock does not wedge the store | both forms reclaimed within the 5 s window | Proven |
| A stray file in `.txn/` refuses the write it would otherwise crash on, rather than bricking the workspace forever | `{"garbage":true}` in `.txn/tstale.json` made every `set` an uncaught `TypeError` (`journal.files is not iterable`) at exit 1 while `doctor` reported the workspace clean; now `set` refuses `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`/`S13` at exit 6 naming the file, `doctor` reports the same finding at exit 7, `show`, `status` and `backlog` keep answering, and deleting the file restores writes at exit 0 (`test/store/journal.test.ts`) | Proven |
| A journal cannot write outside the workspace | A `.txn/` file naming `../../victim/pwned.txt` replayed at exit 0, landed the file outside the workspace and deleted the journal behind it; every escaping path (a relative walk, an absolute path, a directory the layout does not draw, a nested path, `.txn/` itself) is now refused `S13` at exit 6, nothing is written outside the root, and the journal is left on disk for a reader to find (`test/store/journal.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The lock wait is bounded against a holder that never lets go, and never bounded against one that keeps changing hands | Against a live, heartbeating holder that never releases, a waiter used to be killed by an external alarm having printed nothing; it now refuses at `holderTimeoutMs` naming the holder's pid, host and how long it has held the lock. A lock that changes hands every 100 ms is still acquired after 900 ms of waiting, three times a 300 ms bound (`test/store/lock.test.ts`) | Proven |
| A file name the line grammar would end a value at does not take a reporting surface down | A shard or journal file named with an embedded newline crashed `doctor` with `INTERNAL` at exit 1, the one surface that would have named it; the name is now escaped (`a\nb.md`) in every finding and refusal that carries it, on one line (`test/store/sharded-store.test.ts`, `test/store/journal.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The store holds under its declared ceilings | 1.1 million events at 239 MB, still parsed and served | Proven |
| No write leaves a record naming an id the store does not hold | The interleavings, two store instances on one workspace with the first held at its `apply`: before, each landed - a `blocks` edge on a removed item, and two orders leaving a `parent_id` on one, both of which `doctor` reported clean at exit 0. After, each is refused inside the write lock, `S17` for the removal and `S10` for the parent write, with the store holding no edge and no parent to a missing record (`test/services/removal-race.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The rule costs nothing the 24-writer proof can see | Five interleaved rounds a side at a 1-minute load of 2.6: 24 of 24 writes persisted in all ten, 0 lost updates, 0 corrupt shards, 0 quarantined; compare-and-set attempts 56 to 76 before and 58 to 78 after, wall 2,353 to 2,679 ms before and 2,389 to 2,635 ms after (`test/store/lock.test.ts`) | Proven |
| A `parent_id` naming no record is a finding rather than a clean report | A hand edit that drops the parent record: before, `doctor` printed `clean checked 1 item and 3 events` and exited 0 while `show` still printed the parent; after, `H30` names the record, the field and the line that clears it, and `doctor` exits 7. The record stays writable, because the rule watches the write that introduces the reference and not the reference (`test/services/dangling-parent.test.ts`) | Proven |
| A pull request cannot silently remove a test that main has | The reconstructed pull request 29 resolution reports 1122 of 1122 tests passing and is refused by `check-tests-kept` naming 32 titles; over all 29 pull requests in main's history, 25 pass and 4 need 9 declarations between them, every one a title whose behaviour changed (`test/architecture/tests-kept.test.ts`) | Proven |
| An epic is a container, never the thing to pick up, and keeps only the ceremony it can earn | Before, `next` ranked the container `ship-it` first over an epic with two ready children, `transition ship-it in_review` succeeded at exit 0, and `done` was then refused for a missing reviewer and evidence it never had. After, `next` prints both children and no epic, `next --explain-absence ship-it` names `type epic; a container is never the thing to pick up, its children are`, `in_review` is refused at `G5` naming `an epic has no review step, so in_progress exits through done`, and `done` is refused for the one real reason, its open children; `G8` and `DOR8` are unchanged, so closing an effort still refuses while a child is open and grooming an empty epic still refuses at `DOR8` (`test/services/epic-is-a-container.test.ts`) | Proven |
| `status` names a store no write can pass, rather than reporting a healthy count over one | Before, `status` printed `items N findings 0` and exited 0 over a store where every write was refused, while the write itself refused at exit 6, `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`/`S13`. After, `status` still exits 0, because the read genuinely succeeded, and it also prints a `writes` line carrying the write's own refusal cause and a `fix` line carrying its own remedy, verbatim, over the four causes PR #83 gave fix lines for: a stray `.txn/stray.json`, a `.txn/wedged.json` entry that cannot be read, a shard directory this user cannot write, and a `.txn/` directory that cannot be listed or cannot be written; a store where every write can pass prints neither line (`test/cli/status-over-unwritable-store.test.ts`) | Proven |
| A release that publishes nothing says so, and names every block rather than the first | Before, a skipped `publish` job wrote no annotation, no step summary and no line on the release, and the Release run concluded success: the only mention of `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED` anywhere in the run was the `if:` condition that skipped the job. After, the release carries a `## Publication` section naming both blocks, the variable unset and `"private": true`, and the run carries a warning naming their count; 11 cases drive the job's own shell out of the workflow over skipped, failed, succeeded and unrecognised publish results (`test/release/publication-decision.test.ts`) | Proven |
| A release tag the release path can actually check | Before, `scripts/release-preflight.ts` required a signature `git verify-tag` accepts, and no runner can accept one: verifying an SSH signature needs an allowed-signers file and a fresh runner has none. On the real `v0.1.1` run `34475691252` all six `cross-platform` jobs passed and `artifacts` failed with `tag v0.1.1 carries no signature git could verify`. Reproduced in a clone of `v0.1.1` with `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` at `/dev/null`, where `git verify-tag` prints `Good "git" signature ...` and then `No principal matched.` at exit 1. After, the same tree and the same tag pass at `release preflight: ok, v0.1.1 is this run's tag at bcec4b7...`, and a `--commit` naming any other commit still refuses. The clause is decidable from the repository and the run rather than from the machine's configuration ([ADR-0037](architecture/adr/0037-the-automation-cuts-the-tag-and-no-release-carries-a-human-signature.md), `test/release/preflight.test.ts`) | Proven |
| The release pull request's parked runs are released by the run rather than by a person | Before, forty-six runs on `release-please--branches--main--components--treadle` had concluded `action_required`, `gh pr checks 69` answered `no checks reported`, and four release pull requests waited four days; `parked-checks` reported that state and approved nothing. After, `release-pr-checks` runs `scripts/approve-release-checks.ts` under the run's own token with `actions: write`, approves every parked run on the pull request's current head, and waits for them to leave that state rather than for its own call to return. 17 cases drive it through its own request function, including one impostor per narrowing clause, a head whose runs have not been created yet, and a head that never gets one (`test/release/approve-release-checks.test.ts`) | Proven against a fake forge, not against a release |

## What is not proven

**Performance and efficiency.**
No figure here is a performance measurement, and the fuzzing budget is a ceiling rather than a benchmark.
A separate branch owns that work.

**What a closed-by-absence finding proves, and what it does not.**
F1, F7 and F11 closed by removing their surface rather than by guarding it, which [architecture/adr/0012-the-extension-surface-that-does-not-ship.md](architecture/adr/0012-the-extension-surface-that-does-not-ship.md) argues, and F4 closed the same way when [architecture/adr/0035-a-verdict-that-records-nothing-and-a-rendering-for-a-person-go.md](architecture/adr/0035-a-verdict-that-records-nothing-and-a-rendering-for-a-person-go.md) cut the Markdown export it had been waiting on.
The first three name tests proving that nothing under `src/` starts a process, evaluates a string, reads a hook setting or writes a file outside the five modules `WRITERS` in `test/security/f11-adapter-write-safety.test.ts` names: the store's four writers and the workspace resolver.
F4 names `test/render/conformance.test.ts`, which holds the shipped rendering set to the three `RENDERINGS` declares, none of them a format a spreadsheet opens.
None of the four proves that the removed surface would be safe if it were built: a guarded export and a gated hook contract are both open questions this tree answers by not having either.
They are also not evidence about a publish that has never happened: F13's third control, provenance at publish, is asserted over the workflow and the preflight script rather than over a publish that happened.

**The tag half of the release pipeline, run for real once and still short of a release that carries anything.**
Three tags have fired it and none produced a release with assets on it.
On `v0.1.0`, run `34453354302`, `cross-platform` ran on the tag and its three container jobs failed for want of `TREADLING_ACTOR`, so `artifacts`, `publish`, `publication` and `smoke` all skipped behind them.
On `v0.1.1`, run `34475691252`, all six `cross-platform` jobs passed and `artifacts` failed on the tag-signature clause the row above records.

[ADR-0037](architecture/adr/0037-the-automation-cuts-the-tag-and-no-release-carries-a-human-signature.md) changed what fires those jobs: there is no tag trigger any more, `release-tag` creates the tag behind the matrix, and everything downstream keys on `needs.release-tag.outputs.created`.
`v0.1.2` exercised that shape on 2026-09-10 and it worked.
`release-tag` in run `34488379552` created the tag and the release at 14:25:28Z, `artifacts` ran on `created == 'true'` in job `102910409340`, and the run for the release commit itself reached `release-tag` four minutes later, found nothing left to release, and skipped `artifacts` correctly.

That job is the first and only end-to-end run of `artifacts`, and it reached its last step.
`npm ci`, `npm run build`, the preflight's accept path against a tag the run had just created, `npm pack`, the SBOM export, `SHA256SUMS`, and `actions/attest-build-provenance` signing through the workflow's OIDC identity, uploaded to Rekor at `logIndex=2784103717` and to the repository as attestation `46592135`.
Then `gh release create` ended the job on `a release with the same tag name already exists: v0.1.2`, because release-please had created the release two seconds earlier.

Every step of `artifacts` that can run without a tag was run in a worktree on 2026-09-10, in the workflow's own order and with its own commands, on Node 24.20.0 and npm 11.19.0 rather than the 24.15.0 `.nvmrc` pins: `npm ci`, `npm run build` at 386,054 bytes against DR8's 768,000, `npm pack --json --ignore-scripts` producing `treadling-0.1.0.tgz` at 116,490 bytes, the dependency-graph SBOM export at 107,021 bytes of SPDX-2.3 over 134 packages, and `sha256sum` over both into a `SHA256SUMS` that verifies against both files.
The preflight's accept path was exercised twice: against the real `v0.1.1` tag in a clone configured the way a runner is, and through `scripts/rollback-drill.sh`, 13 of 13 on 2026-09-10 including the notes it writes and each of the six publishing refusals on a manifest broken to make it fire.
`notesFor` was run against release pull request 69's own changelog and returned the 104-line 0.1.0 section with no leak into a second heading.

`gh release edit` and `gh release upload --clobber`, which replaced the failed create, were run against this repository on 2026-09-10, on a throwaway tag rather than a release.
`proof-artifacts-upload-20260910` was created outside the tag ruleset's live `refs/tags/v*` pattern, read from ruleset `22316869` rather than from `.github/rulesets/tags.json`, and deleted and read back as gone once before anything was attached to it.
A draft release was opened on it by a separate act, standing in for the release release-please makes, and the workflow's two commands were then run verbatim against the three assets built from the `v0.1.2` tree.
The release came back from the forge carrying `sbom.spdx.json` at 107,021 bytes, `SHA256SUMS` at 165 and `treadling-0.1.2.tgz` at 116,715, all `uploaded`, with the stand-in body replaced by the CHANGELOG section; running the same upload again left three assets rather than failing on the first, which is the `--clobber` clause.
The release and the tag were then deleted, and the forge reports no release and no ref by that name and the same three `v` tags as before.

Two limits on that proof. It used a draft, and `gh release create` succeeds against a draft on the same tag, so the shipped step's `a release with the same tag name already exists` refusal reproduces only against a published one: job `102910409340` is where that half is evidenced. And the assets were built on this machine rather than by the runner, so nothing in it exercises `actions/attest-build-provenance` a second time.

The `publish` and `smoke` jobs still have not run, and need a publish.
The sibling repository `pointback` runs the same two commands in the same position, and its `v0.1.2` and `v0.1.3`, both authored by `github-actions[bot]`, carry their tarball and their SBOM.
`release-pr-checks` has been driven only against a fake forge, so nothing yet shows a real parked run being approved.
F13's third control stays asserted over the workflow and the preflight rather than over a publish that happened.

**Coverage-guided fuzzing.**
The fuzzer here is mutation-based over a committed corpus.
A parser with deep state would deserve a coverage-guided one; this one is a single linear pass with no backtracking, which is asserted rather than assumed by the star-height scan.
[ADR-0007](architecture/adr/0007-proving-the-properties.md) records why no fuzzing dependency was added.

**Correctness of the domain rules themselves.**
Every property above is about the machinery: the parser round-trips, the renderer cannot be made to forge a line, the store does not lose a write.
Whether the definition-of-ready gate asks for the right things is a product question these tests do not touch.

## Coverage

`npm run coverage` runs the suite under Node's own coverage and holds the result to a table in `scripts/coverage.ts`.
The overall gate is 90% lines and 85% branches; the named files are held to 95% and 90%, because those are exactly the files a project-wide average hides.

| File | What it is | Held to | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/adapters/store/grammar.ts` | parser and serializer | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| `src/domain/state-machine.ts` | state machine | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| `src/domain/text.ts` | escaper: the safe-text class | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| `src/adapters/render/grammar.ts` | escaper: the line grammar guards | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| `src/adapters/workspace.ts` | path resolution: the workspace walk | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| `src/adapters/target.ts` | path resolution: the store seam target | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| `src/adapters/store/lock.ts` | lock | 95% lines, 90% branches | met |
| all files | | 90% lines, 85% branches | 97.07 to 97.66 lines, 89.08 to 89.69 branches across three runs on pull request 6 |

The overall figures are ranges rather than points, because they move between runs and a single decimal would be spuriously precise.
The concurrency and durability suites are real processes: how many trials leave a lock file for the next writer to reclaim, how many journalled transactions a kill leaves to be replayed, and how many compare-and-set attempts 24 writers need are all decided by the scheduler, so each run takes a slightly different set of branches through `lock.ts` and the store.
What is asserted is the gate, which every run met, not the decimal.
A count that measures a claim is kept here; a count that measures only the size of the tree is not, because it rots into a false statement on the next commit.

The gate has been seen red: before the tests pull request 6 added, `src/adapters/workspace.ts` sat at 80.17% lines and 65.22% branches and `src/adapters/store/lock.ts` at 88.37% branches, and `npm run coverage` named all three misses with their numbers and exited non-zero.
Writing those tests is what found the crash below.

## Flake

`npm run flake` runs the whole suite 20 times in a row and reports the count that completed alongside the count that passed.
It also fails if the test count moves between runs, because a suite that decides at runtime how much to check would pass while checking nothing.

Measured on the branch that added this section: 20 of 20 runs completed, 20 green, 0 failed, a test count that did not move across the 20, and 1,147 s in total.
The count itself is deliberately not repeated here, because the paragraph above says a number that measures the size of the tree rots into a false statement on the next commit, and this one did: it read 757 for six pull requests after the suite had grown past it, where `node --test "test/**/*.test.ts"` reported 1,146 on 2026-09-06 and 1,499, then 1,750, then 1,819, on 2026-09-07 as two rounds of audit fixes and the first-run capabilities landed.
That command is the number's only authority, and it is one line to run.
What the gate asserts is zero failures and a count that does not move within a run set, which is the part a later commit cannot make false.
Individual runs ranged from 49.8 s to 88.6 s, which is a 1.78x spread on a shared machine and is the reason the fuzzer's time bound is generous rather than tight.
The figure before pull request 6 was 626 s over 20 runs of a smaller suite on an idle machine, ranging 27.1 s to 34.4 s; what both runs assert is the budget of zero failures and a test count that does not move, never the seconds.

One flake was found and fixed in that same work, in a test written during it: the fuzzer's per-input time budget of 250 ms was measuring the machine rather than the code, and a 12-byte input crossed it on a loaded run.
Catastrophic backtracking is an orders-of-magnitude event, so the budget is now 2 s and the real claim is carried by the star-height scan, which is deterministic.

A tight timing bound in a test is a machine measurement wearing a correctness costume.

## The three defects pull request 13 closed, red then green

Each was found by driving the built command surface, and each was reproduced against the tree before the fix.
The transcripts are the two scripts under the task's scratch directory; the numbers below are what they printed.

**Severity reached nobody.**
`show`, `explain`, `backlog`, `status` and `next` printed it 0 times for an S1 production bug, `show --field severity` exited 2 with `C2` naming the six fields the record did carry, and `backlog --fields id,sev,title` exited 2 because there was no such column.
`next` scored an S1 bug, an S4 bug and a chore at priority 1 as 50, 50 and 50; `chore` was a work-item type when that was measured and ADR-0031 has since folded it into `task`.
After: all five surfaces carry it, and the same three score 74, 56 and 50 with `v4`, `v1` and `v0` in the printed components.

**A lowered severity had no author.**
`grep -c severity` over the event log returned 0, and a `file` event's `after` was `{"state":"draft","type":"bug"}`.
A hand edit taking S1 to S4 and priority 1 to 5 left `findings 0` and the same 7 event lines.
After: the `file` event carries `{"type":"bug","state":"draft","filed_at":...,"priority":"1","severity":"S1","found_in":"production"}`, a `mark` carries `before`, `after`, the actor and the reason, and the same hand edit is two `H20` findings on `doctor` and on `explain`.

**Both prose doors were open.**
A 90,000-character description was accepted and left a 90,675-byte shard; a 10,000-character reason produced a 10,287-byte event line.
After: both are refused, each naming the field, the observed length, the limit and the difference, and the shard is byte-identical to what it was before the refused write.

**And the evidence rule that ships with them.**
A bug with a reviewer, a confirmed fix and no evidence is refused at `done` with `DOD7` as the only failing rule, and `explain` prints `treadling evidence add retry-key <kind> <ref> [label]` as the remedy.
Two pointers cost 2 rows on `show` and one `## Evidence` section in the shard.
A ref carrying a space is refused, an invented kind is refused naming the seven, a duplicate is refused, and the twenty-first entry is refused naming the count and the limit.

The bound that could not go where it was written is recorded too, because the first build got it wrong.
Applying the narrowed `description` bound on the load path made a 42,000-character record unservable: `show` exited 4 and `doctor` reported `checked 0`.
Reading always works, so the bound is a write-time rule and the store's S5 ceiling is the load bound.

A bound that stops an old file from being read is not a bound, it is a data loss.

## The fourth field of one class, and the gate that ends it

Question 15 of the benchmark's question-coverage axis, "who changed X", scored `none`, with this verdict:

> every event carries an actor and no read surface prints one; the answer is in the store and not behind a command

That is the third instance of one defect: a field captured faithfully on every write and shown by no command.
`severity` was required at creation and printed nowhere, a severity change was recorded in no event, and the actor is on every event line and reached no command.
So pull request 13 answered the question and then swept the whole dictionary for the same shape.

**The sweep, measured.**
The store persisted 35 work-item fields and 14 event keys at pull request 13's base; ADR-0029 retired three of them on 2026-09-08, ADR-0032 retired `reporter` on 2026-09-09, and the union over the six types is 31 now.
Counted against the shapes at pull request 13's base, 18 of the 35 and 11 of the 14 reached no read surface at all: `actual`, `component`, `expected`, `extra`, `findings`, `fix_confirmed`, `found_in`, `held_from`, `hold_reason`, `hold_until`, `hours_estimate`, `labels`, `outcome`, `question`, `reporter`, `repro_steps`, `reviewer` and `timebox_hours` on the record, and `actor`, `actor_kind`, `entity_kind`, `entity`, `op`, `before`, `after`, `guards`, `outcome`, `cmd` and `txn` in the log.
Of those 29, 24 are readable now and 5 are declared hidden with a reason.

**Question 15's answer, as it prints.**
`history <id>` is the reader [ADR-0011](architecture/adr/0011-evidence-and-the-severity-audit.md) named when it widened the `file` event to carry the fields an item was created with.

```text
$ treadling history pay-hook
ok history demo
item pay-hook
sort at desc
~events 4 4
#at kind op "what "by
2026-09-05T12:10:07Z human item.transition state kim
2026-09-05T12:10:07Z human item.transition state ravi
2026-09-05T12:10:07Z agent item.mark severity agent-7
2026-09-05T12:10:06Z human item.file type,state,filed_at,priority,severity,found_in dana
```

`explain` gains one line for the same fact about the write that put the item where it is, because that is where the axis looked and it already reads that event for `since` and `from_event`:

```text
$ treadling explain pay-hook
...
sev S1
"by kim
```

The decision per field is in `test/architecture/field-visibility.test.ts` rather than here, because a table in a document drifts and that one is executed.
Every persisted field has a line naming the result key that carries it or the reason it stays hidden, and a field with neither fails by name.

**Red before green.**
Three trees, each pull request 13's tip with one part of the fix removed.
Back out `show`'s field additions and the gate says `item hours_estimate claims show:hrs, and the show shape declares no hrs`.
Keep the shape and remove only the assignments and it says `hours_estimate claims show:hrs and no record printed hrs`, so declaring a surface that never prints the field is not a way through.
Remove the `by` column and the gate states question 15 as a failing assertion: `event actor claims history:by, and the history shape declares no by`.
The three CLI cases in `test/cli/found-by-use.test.ts` fail at pull request 13's base too: `history` exits 2 as an unknown command, `explain` prints no `by`, and a 201-character actor is accepted.

**What it costs, in bytes.**
The A.3 budgets are unchanged and every budgeted artefact is inside its own.
The golden `show` is a story carrying none of the new fields and is 273 B against 310 as before; `explain` moves 429 B to 438 B against 754.
`history` is a new command and A.3 carries no figure for it: the golden is 280 B, gated here at 380 B, which is the 75 percent fill A.3 gave `backlog` (717 of 960) and `next` (380 of 510).

The finding A.3 does not cover is that one budget for `show` is measured on one record type.
The same workspace, read with pull request 13's base and then with its tip: a bug goes 263 B to 604 B, a spike 121 B to 336 B, an epic 119 B to 172 B, an item on hold 129 B to 218 B, and a cancelled chore, the type ADR-0031 later folded into `task`, stays at 142 B.
A bug is the expensive record because a bug has six more stored fields than a task, three of them prose, and the reason its `show` looked cheap was that those fields were not printed.
That is a budget for the budget owner to state per type, not a set of required fields to hide so a story's figure holds.

A field a caller can set and cannot read back is a field the tool cannot answer for.

## The defect pull request 6 found

Writing the coverage gate exposed two reachable filesystem-failure paths on the same class.
`treadling init` where `.work` is already a file, and `treadling file` into a shard directory with its write bit off.
At the base pull request 6 rebases onto, pull request 4's command-boundary backstop already turns both into a structured envelope with no stack trace.

```text
err INTERNAL -
"cause init did not complete: Error: ENOTDIR: not a directory, mkdir '.../.work/items'
fix treadling version
```

Both were reported as `INTERNAL` with exit 1 and no rule id.
A filesystem that refuses a write is the store being unavailable, which [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) maps to exit 6.
`createWorkspace` declared a result type it never used, and `apply` let an errno escape the same way.
Both now return `STORE_UNAVAILABLE` with the rule id `S13`, and `run` carries a backstop for anything that still escapes.

```text
err STORE_UNAVAILABLE -
rule S13
"cause the workspace at .../.work could not be created: mkdir failed with ENOTDIR
```

`test/cli/robustness.test.ts` fails 3 of 3 against the old sources and passes against the new ones.

A return type that says it reports failures has to report them.

## The unreadable store that read as empty, closed by pull request 67, red then green

The read path swallowed every errno the filesystem gave it, and a store nothing could open
answered as a store holding nothing. Driven through the built bundle on a workspace holding
two records, with `chmod 000` on the paths, at `1bc0049`:

```text
$ chmod 000 .work/items && treadling status --out agent
ok status <workspace>
items 0
findings 0
rc=0
$ treadling doctor --out agent
ok doctor <workspace>
checked 0
clean checked 0 items and 3 events
rc=0
$ treadling show first-task --out agent
err NOT_FOUND <workspace>
"cause first-task is in no record here; this workspace holds 0 items
rc=5
$ chmod 755 .work/items && chmod 000 .work/items/*.md && treadling status --out agent
err INTERNAL -
"cause status did not complete: Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '.../.work/items/2026-09.md'
fix treadling version
rc=1
$ chmod 644 .work/items/*.md && chmod 000 .work/events && treadling history first-task --out agent
ok history <workspace>
none first-task has no recorded change
rc=0
```

Four commands reported an empty workspace at exit 0 over records that exist, one reported a
record that exists as `NOT_FOUND`, and the shard case escaped as `INTERNAL` with a raw path
and no rule id. The events directory was the fourth surface and was not in the report that
found the first three.

After, on the same script, every one of the same paths:

```text
err STORE_UNAVAILABLE -
rule S13
entity .../.work
"cause .../.work/items could not be read: scandir failed with EACCES
fix treadling status
rc=6
```

with `.../.work/items/2026-09.md could not be read: open failed with EACCES` for the shard and
`.../.work/events could not be read: scandir failed with EACCES` for the log, in all three
renderings, at exit 6. `test/cli/unreadable-store.test.ts` is the regression, and it fails
against the sources before this change.

A store that cannot be read says so. It does not answer.

## The gate that demanded a field nothing could set, closed by pull request 24

Two defects on the field surface, both found by driving the built bundle and both invisible to every suite.

**A gate can demand a field no command can set.**
A bug filed without `expected` and `actual` was refused at the ready gate with `GUARD_REFUSED rule G1, the ready gate fails: DOR6, DOR7`, and `explain` printed the remedy `set expected on checkout-drops-paid-orders`.
No such command existed: the mutating surface was `init`, `file`, `transition`, `mark` and `evidence`, and none of them writes a stored field after creation.
`explain` on the done gate printed `record a reviewer` and `set fix_confirmed to true`, so the same dead end sat on both gates, and `doctor` reported the workspace clean with the stuck item in it.
The item was unadvanceable for good, because filing before you know the details is the normal order.

**The write path and the read path disagreed about a field's name.**
`file task "x" --set description=` was accepted and `--set desc=` refused with `V5, desc is not a field of any work item`, while `show <id> --field desc` printed the block and `--field description` was refused with `C2, carries no field named description`.
Each path's refusal asserted the other path's name did not exist.

**What holds them closed.**
`test/domain/gate-remedies.test.ts` sweeps every remedy the shipped gates and two probe gates can emit and asserts each names a command the inventory carries.
It fails 29 of 34 against the tree before the fix, with `ready DOR6`, `ready DOR7`, `done DOD3` and `done DOD6` among the named failures.
Every check kind in the evaluator carries a line saying which command performs its remedy, and a context in the sweep that makes it fail; `no_open_impediment` was the one kind declared unbuildable until the impediment type landed, and now names `transition`, because resolving an impediment is reaching `done`.
`writerOf` in the field dictionary is now the single statement of which command writes which field, read by the field editor and by the gate remedies, so a rule cannot tell a caller to `set severity` when `mark` is what writes it.
`canonicalField` is the single statement of a field's two spellings, and `test/architecture/field-visibility.test.ts` holds it to the same table that says which surface prints each field.
Two end-to-end cases in `test/cli/found-by-use.test.ts` drive the whole path: a bug reaches `ready` by running the remedy `explain` printed, verbatim, and both spellings of `description` work on both paths.

**What it costs, in bytes.**
`explain` moves 429 B to 471 B against an allowance that moves 754 to 762, because a remedy that names a command is longer than a sentence and the budget grows four bytes per occurrence of the binary name.
Every other budgeted artefact is byte-identical.

A remedy is a promise, and a remedy naming no command is a promise nothing keeps.

**A remedy naming a command is not yet a promise kept.**
Eleven of the 41 command shapes the source emitted at the time were refused when run as printed with only the placeholder filled: `treadling transition <blocker> done` from a blocker in `draft`, `ready`, `in_review` or `on_hold` (`T1`), a two-flag clash fix with its operands dropped, `on_hold --until` without `--reason`, `set` naming the first three settable fields of the whole dictionary on a type that lacks the first, `mark --severity` on a task, `treadling init` on a workspace that already exists, and three shapes that went with the sprint in ADR-0029.
Every `page` and `whole` line dropped the caller's filters, `--fields`, `--limit` and `--for`, so `backlog --state draft --limit 2` printed a cursor whose page was six unfiltered rows including a `done` item.
`test/cli/runnable-lines.test.ts` holds all of it by running the lines: 145 provocations over nine workspace states collect 90 or more distinct lines, each is filled from one placeholder table, tokenised as a shell would and run in-process on a fresh copy of the state that printed it, and each has to exit 0 or with an exit the inventory declares as a verdict.
Three more cases walk a filtered `backlog`, a `next --for` and a `history` by the lines they print and assert the pages concatenate to what the same filter prints in one page.
A remedy is built from the blocker's own legal targets, `nextTowardDone` in `src/domain/state-machine.ts`, and a `page` line from the request that produced it, `invocation` in `src/application/services/items.ts`.

A line the reader is told to run is verified by running it, from where the reader stands.

## The revert a green suite could not see, and the check pull request 29 grew from it

Pull request 28 landed the acceptance-criteria readback and the `what` column convention.
Pull request 29 was rebased onto it, four service files conflicted, and the resolution took the pre-rebase file whole, deleting 28's code and 28's tests together.
The suite passed on 1132 tests and all ten checks were green.

The reconstruction is a branch off `3bce1ca` with those four service files and their tests back at their pre-28 state.

```text
$ npm test
ℹ tests 1122
ℹ pass 1122
ℹ fail 0

$ treadling set cart acceptance_criteria=...
set acceptance_criteria - -> [object Object]        # main: [ ] a shopper reopens a saved cart
$ treadling show cart --field ac
ac 0/1                                              # main: ac 0/1, then ~criteria 1 1 and the text

$ node scripts/check-tests-kept.ts 3bce1ca HEAD
FAIL  the what column of history has one convention
      test/services/history-convention.test.ts declares it at 3bce1ca and this branch does not
      restore the test, or record the removal in a commit message trailer:
        Removes-test: the what column of history has one convention
check-tests-kept: 772 tests at 3bce1ca4, ... 32 removed without a Removes-test trailer
```

Every test declaration in this repository is read and compared, and the run prints how many it could not read: `0 titles not literal and not compared` on 2026-09-07, at 1,001 declarations against 987 at the merge base.
A title built from a template literal is compared in a canonical form with each interpolation reduced to `${}`, so the per-file `it` in `test/architecture/license-header.test.ts` is one comparable title rather than an uncompared one.
The count is the run's own, not this file's, which is the point of printing it.

### What check-tests-kept does not see

**A test that keeps its title and loses its body.**
The mechanism compares names, so a resolution that empties an assertion while leaving `it('...', () => {})` standing is invisible to it.
That is the case a manifest of behaviours checked against the built binary would answer, and [architecture/adr/0013-a-branch-may-not-remove-a-test-main-has.md](architecture/adr/0013-a-branch-may-not-remove-a-test-main-has.md) prices it.

**A subtest declared as `t.test(...)` rather than at the start of a line.**
There are none here, and a file that adds one fails the check with the file named rather than passing over it, because the gate counts the declaration-shaped calls it did not read.

**A test whose title the reader cannot resolve to a literal at all.**
It is counted and printed rather than skipped, so an uncompared declaration is a number a reader can see rather than a silence. It was 0 on 2026-09-07 and is 2 on 2026-09-10, and the run itself is the authority for it rather than this line.

**A branch that is not up to date with main.**
The comparison is against the merge base, so a test main gained after the fork is not one this branch removed.
`strict_required_status_checks_policy` is what makes that safe: a branch behind main cannot merge, so the run a merge is gated on compares against main's tip.

## Running it

The README's Quick start carries the gate commands and what each one runs.
Two forms belong to this file's subject rather than to that block: `npm run flake -- 5` is a shorter local check than the 20-run default, and `TREADLING_FUZZ_INPUTS=<n> npm test` raises the fuzzer above its gate count for a soak run.
`npm run tests-kept` is the third, and AGENTS.md carries it beside the trailer that declares a removal.
